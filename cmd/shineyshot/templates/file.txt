Usage: {{.Program}} file -file PATH <operation> [arguments]

Operations:
  capture [flags] <screen|window|region> [selector]
                         capture into the file using screen, window, or region modes
  draw <shape> [...]      add markup such as lines, arrows, numbers, text, or masks
  annotate [flags] capture <screen|window|region> [selector]
                         capture via the annotation UI with optional selectors
  annotate [flags] open   open the file in the annotation UI for manual edits
  preview                 view the file in a simple Linux viewer window

The nested command inherits the provided path. The wrapper pre-populates
`-output` when calling into `snapshot` and both `-file`/`-output` for `draw`,
`annotate`, and `preview` so the subcommand works against the managed file.
Supply the flags again inside the subcommand to write to a different
destination.
